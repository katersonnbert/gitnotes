Installing the Linux Guest Additions
The VirtualBox Guest Additions for Linux are provided on the same virtual CD-ROM file as the Guest Additions for Windows described above. They also come with an installation program guiding you through the setup process, although, due to the significant differences between Linux distributions, installation may be slightly more complex.
1) Again, as with Linux hosts, we recommend using DKMS if it is available for the guest system. If it is not installed, use this command for Ubuntu/Debian systems:
    sudo apt-get install dkms
Be sure to install DKMS before installing the Linux Guest Additions. If DKMS is not available or not installed, the guest kernel modules will need to be recreated manually whenever the guest kernel is updated using the command

2) mount VBoxGuestAdditions
If you prefer to mount the additions manually, you can perform the following steps:
    Start VBox, Settings, Storage, add VBGuestAdditions.iso (usually under C:\Program files\Oracle\VirtualBox).
3) Start the VirtualBox, change to the directory where your CD-ROM drive is mounted (usually /media/[path]) and execute as root:
	sudo sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
For your convenience, we provide the following step-by-step instructions for freshly installed copies of recent versions of the most popular Linux distributions. After these preparational steps, you can execute the VirtualBox Guest Additions installer as described above.
4) Restart the VirtualBox.

- Add shared folder between host and guest OS:
